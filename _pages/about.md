I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation at NEU](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
My research interest includes computer vision and robotics.

I'm very fortunate to be a visiting scholar at ([NYU AI4CE LAB](https://ai4ce.github.io/)) led by Prof. Chen Feng.
